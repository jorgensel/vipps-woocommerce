The GET:/vipps-userinfo-api/userinfo/{sub} endpoint is shared between the Vipps eCom API and the Vipps Login API and the merchant needs to have activated Vipps Login to use this feature.

Once the user completes the session a unique identifier sub can be retrieved from the GET:/ecomm/v2/payments/{orderId}/details endpoint.

Example sub format:

"sub": "c06c4afe-d9e1-4c5d-939a-177d752a0944",

This sub is a link between the merchant and the user and can used to retrieve the user's details from Vipps Login: GET:/vipps-userinfo-api/userinfo/{sub}

Please note: There is a time limit of 24 hours to retrieve the consented profile data from the userinfo endpoint.
